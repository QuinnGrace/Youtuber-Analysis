# YouTuber Analysis

## Expected Outcomes
- Identify trends in the top streamers and their audiences
- Propose a system for enhancing content recommendations to YouTube users based on streamers' categories and performance metrics

## Tools Used
- Jupyter Notebook (Python)
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas

## Output
This is only a snapshot of the analysis done, please see the notebook in the repository for more.







## Conclusions
- The most popular categories appear to be toys and movies about video games
- Rank was weakly inversely correlated with the number of visits and strongly inversely correlated with the number of subscribers.
- Categories were weakly inversely correlated with country, so YouTubers tend to have categories correlated with the country they are in.
- Visits were strongly correlated with likes, moderately correlated with comments and weakly correlated with subscribers.
- Likes were moderately correlated with comments and weakly correlated with subscribers.
- Streamers from African countries appear to have the lowest subscriber counts (specifically Egypt, Morocco, and Somalia). Streamers with the highest subscriber counts came from a variety of countries (Ecuador, India, and unknown).
- Music and dance is the most common category in most countries, with the notable exception of YouTubers from an unknown country being more likely to make animation videos. In Indonesia, Mexico, and Russia, Movies are the most popular category type.
- Medical reasons were by far the most common cause of absences
- Drinkers took the most unjustified leave (70%)
- Reason 15 (medical reason) for absenteeism only happened on Mondays and Fridays
- Employees with 4 children took more leave than employees with fewer children
- Obese employees made up only a quarter of employees but a third of all medical leave 

## Recommendations
- Reduce or spread out workload in Spring
- Engage with and provide support to employees with high numbers of absences
- Host events encouraging healthy lifestyles and remodel the office to incentivise healthy choices
- Discourage heavy drinking
- Provide further support to employees with 4 children, such as providing childcare
